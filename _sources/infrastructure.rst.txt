In a workflow, physics modules exchange physics data in the form of
standardised blocks of information: the Consistent Physical Objects
(CPOs). The list of CPOs as well as their inner structure defines the EU-IM
Data Structure. All physics modules should use these standardised
interfaces for I/O.

Introduction to Kepler - basics
-------------------------------

`Kepler <https://kepler-project.org/>`__ is a workflow engine and design
platform for analyzing and modeling scientific data. Kepler provides a
graphical interface and a library of pre-defined components to enable users
to construct scientific workflows which can undertake a wide range of
functionality. It is primarily designed to access, analyse, and visualise
scientific data but can be used to construct whole programs or run
pre-existing simulation codes.

Kepler builds upon the mature Ptolemy II framework, developed at the
University of California, Berkeley. Kepler itself is developed and
maintained by the cross-project Kepler collaboration.

The main components in a Kepler workflow are actors, which are used in a
design (inherited from Ptolemy II) that separates workflow components
("actors") from workflow orchestration ("directors"), making components
more easily reusable. Workflows can work at very levels of granularity,
from low-level workflows (that explicitly move data around or start and
monitor remote jobs, for example) to high-level workflows that interlink
complex steps/actors. Actors can be reused to construct more complex
actors enabling complex functionality to be encapsulated in easy to use
packages. A wide range of actors are available for use and reuse.

| **Imas actor**   |      **Deacription**                       |
+==================+============================================+
|UALSliceCollector | | Store one slice from input IDS into      |
|                  |   different run. This way, it is possible  |
|                  | | to collect intermediate results during   |
|                  |   workflow execution.                      |
+------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| UALPython        | | Allows to run external Python process and|
|                  |   pass input/output data between workflow  |
|                  | | and process itself. This actor is, most  |
|                  |   commonly, used for data visualization.   |
|                  | | User can pass Python script directly to  |
|                  |   the actor.                               |
+------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| UALMuxParam      | | Provides similar behavior to             |
|                  |   ualmux/UALMux, however, this actors has  |
|                  | | two additional ports:                    |
|                  | |  - fieldDescription - contains name of   |
|                  |    the filed that will be modified         |
|                  | |  - fieldValue - contains new value of    |
|                  |    the field                               | 
|                  | | Main difference between ualmux/          |      
|                  |   ualmuxparam                              |           
|                  |   actors lays in it's ability to be used   |               
|                  |   in                                       |  
|                  | | a loop that modify different field       |
|                  |   inside IDS.                              |
|                  | | You can simply provide different field   | 
|                  |   name                                     |

|                  | |  - new value of the field is passed as   | 
|                  |    value sent to the port                  | 
|                  | | outputs:                                 |
|                  | |  - outputIds/outputCpo - modified IDS    |

+------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| UALCollector	   | | Stores input IDSess inside new run.      |
|                  |   This way, it is possible to copy data    |

| SetBreakpoint    | | This actor allows to enforce "debug"     |
|                  |   mode for IMAS based actors. It sets      |
|                  | | global parameter "ITM_DEBUG" to either   |
|                  |   true or false. In case true is a value   |

Running Kepler using IMAS environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting up environment
++++++++++++++++++++++

Please do not forget to set JAVA memory settings:

.. code-block:: console
                
        export _JAVA_OPTIONS="-Xss20m -Xms8g -Xmx8g"

Backing up old files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Before first configuration of Kepler, make sure to backup your old data files

.. code-block:: console
                
        cd ~
        mv .kepler .kepler~
        mv KeplerData KeplerData~
        mv .ptolemyII .ptolemyII~

        
Creating place to store your personal installations of Kepler
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

IMAS based installations are stored inside **$HOME/kepler** directory.

Before proceeding further, make sure to create **kepler** directory

.. code-block:: console
                
        # create directory inside $HOME
        cd ~
        mkdir kepler
        
Running Kepler (default release)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In order to start Kepler you have use helper scripts that will install and configure your personal copy of Kepler
   - load IMAS module

     .. code-block:: fortran
                     
             module load imas
             module load kepler
             # NOTE! It might be that you don't have Kepler copy inside your $HOME
             # in that case you need to install it kepler_install_light

   - Start Kepler
      
     .. code-block:: fortran
                     
             # run alias that will execute Kepler

FC2K - Embedding user codes into Kepler
---------------------------------------

This tutorial is designed to introduce the concept of using FC2K tool in order to build Kepler compatible actors.


.. code-block:: console
                
        This tutorial explains
        how to set up codes for FC2K
        how to build actor using FC2K
        how to incorporate actor within Kepler workflow

FC2K basics
~~~~~~~~~~~

What FC2K actually does?
++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Generates a Fortran/CPP wrapper, which intermediates between Kepler actor and user code in terms of:
  
  - reading/writing of in/out physical data (IDS)
  - passing arguments of standard types to/from the actor
    
- Creates a Kepler actor that:
  
  - calls a user code
  - provides error handling
  - calls debugger (if run in "debug" mode)
  - calls batch submission commands for MPI based actors

FC2K main window

Actor description
+++++++++++++++++

.. image:: images/kepler_2.png
   :align: center

This group of graphical controls allows to set the description of the actor and its "place" in hierarchy of Kepler elements in Kepler "Component" browser

- **Project** - defines a branch in Kepler "Component" browser where an actor will be placed
- **Name** - a user defined name of the actor
- **Version** - a user defined version of user codes
- **Subroutine** - A name of user subroutine (Fortran) or function (C++)
  
Environment
+++++++++++

.. image:: images/kepler_3.png
   :align: center


The Environment text fields shows UAL and Kepler locations.

- **Kepler** - Kepler location (usually the same as $KEPLER)
- **UAL** - IMAS UAL location (usually the same as $IMAS_PREFIX)

  
"Arguments" tab explained
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Below you can find explanation of FC2K arguments tab.


.. image:: images/kepler_4.png
   :align: center


- **Type** - Defines a type of an argument. It is possible to choose either IDS based type (e.g. equilibrium, topinfo, etc.) or primitive type (e.g. int, long, double, char)
- **Single slice** - Determines if IDS is passed as single slice or an array. (This setting is valid for IDS types only )
  
  - if turned **ON** - Only one slice is passed. An actor will get an additional port to define a time.
  - if turned **OFF** - All IDSes for given shot run is passed.
    
- **Is array** - Determines if a primitive type  is passed as a scalar or an array
  
  - if turned **ON** - An argument is passed as an array. It requires definition of array size (dynamic array are not supported)
  - if turned **OFF** - An argument is passed as a scalar.
    
- **Array size** - Defines the size of an array of primitive types
- **Input** - Defines argument as an input
- **Output** - Defines argument as an output
- **Label** - User defined name of an argument (and actor port)

.. image:: images/kepler_5.png
   :align: center
  
Please take a look on a screenshot above:

- *equilibrium* - an input parameter - one IDS (slice)
- *amns* - an input parameter - all amns IDS slices stored in given shot/run
- *integer* - an input parameter - a scalar
- *double* - an input parameter - an array of size 10
- *edge* - an in/out parameter - single slice of "edge" IDS
- *waves* - an output parameter - all slices of "waves" IDS

"Parameters" tab explained
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Code specific parameters are all parameters which are specific to the code (like switches, scaling parameters, and parameters for built-in analytical models) as well as parameters to explicitly overrule fields in the ITM data structures.

.. image:: images/kepler_6.png

*"Optional library"*

A "Optional library" field allows to define a path to optional library containing user subroutine/function.

*"Custom libraries"*

"Custom libraries" are non-standard static libraries required for building the user code.

.. image:: images/kepler_9.png
   :align: center


Available operations on libraries list:

- *"Add..."* - Adds a new library to the list
- *"Edit..."* - Edits library path
- *"Remove"* - Removes a new library from the list

*"System libraries"*

"System libraries" are system libraries handled by pkg-config mechanism and required for building the user code.

FC2K - developer guidelines
---------------------------

What code wrapper actually does?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code wrapper intermediates between Kepler actor and user code:

- Passes variables of language built-in types (int, char, etc) from actor to the code
- Reads CPO(s) from UAL and passes data to user code
- Passes input code parameters (XML/XSD files) to user code
- Calls user subroutine/function
- Saves output CPO(s)

Development of Fortran codes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Subroutine syntax
+++++++++++++++++

subroutine name (<in/out arguments list> [,code_parameters] [,diagnostic_info])

- name - subroutine name
- in/out arguments list - a list of input and output subroutine arguments
- diagnostic_info - arbitrary output diagnostic information

Arguments list
++++++++++++++

- A mandatory position
- A list of input and output subroutine arguments including:
  
    - Fortran intrisic data types, eg:
      
       - integer :: input
       - character(50) :: charstring
       - integer,dimension(4) :: tabint
       
    - CPOs, eg:
      
       - type (type_equilibrium),pointer :: equilibriumin(:)
       - type (type_distsource),pointer :: distsourceout(:)

Code parameters
+++++++++++++++

- user defined input parameters
- input / optional
- Argument of type: type_param

.. code-block:: console
         
        type type_param  !
            character(len=132), dimension(:), pointer ::parameters
            character(len=132), dimension(:), pointer ::default_param 
            character(len=132), dimension(:), pointer ::schema        
        endtype

- Derived type type_param describes:
  
  - parameters - Actual value of the code parameters (instance of coparam/parameters in XML format).
  - default_param - Default value of the code parameters (instance of coparam/parameters in XML format).
  - schema - Code parameters schema.

- An example:
  
  - (type_param) :: codeparam{{
    
Diagnostic info
+++++++++++++++

- arbitrary output diagnostic information
  
   - output / optional

  .. code-block:: console
                
          !----  Diagnostic info  ----
          integer, intent(out)     ::     user_out_outputFlag
          character(len=:), pointer, intent(out)    ::    user_out_diagnosticInfo

- outputFlag - indicates if user subroutine was successfully executed

Development of C++ codes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Function syntax
+++++++++++++++

void name ( <in/out arguments list> [,code_parameters] [,diagnostic_info] )

   - name - function name
   - code_parameters - optional - user defined input parameters
   - diagnostic_info -  arbitrary output diagnostic information

Arguments list
++++++++++++++

    - in/out arguments list
    - mandatory
    - a list of input and output function arguments including:
      
        - CPP intrisic data types, eg:
          
          - int &x
          - double &y
            
        - CPOs, eg:
          
          - ItmNs::Itm::antennas & ant
          - ItmNs::Itm::equilibriumArray & eq
            
Code parameters
+++++++++++++++

    - Optional
    - User defined input parameters
    - Argument of type: ItmNs:: codeparam_t &

                  char **parameters;
                  char **default_param;
                  char **schema;
               } codeparam_t;
 

    - A structure codeparam_t describes:
      
        - parameters - Actual value of the code parameters (instance of coparam/parameters in XML format).
        - default_param - Default value of the code parameters (instance of coparam/parameters in XML format).
        - schema - Code parameters schema.
          
    - An example: ItmNs::codeparam_t & codeparam

Diagnostic info

    - arbitrary output diagnostic information
    - output / optional

    .. code-block:: console
                
            void name(...., int* output_flag, char** diagnostic_info)
        

    - output_flag - indicates if user subroutine was successfully executed

        - output_flag = 0  - SUCCESS, no action is taken
        - output_flag > 0  - WARNING, a warning message is displayed, workflow continuue execution
        - output_flag < 0  - ERROR, actor throws an exception, workflow stops

IMAS Kepler 2.1.3 (default release)
-----------------------------------


Installation of default version of Kepler (without actors)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use most recent version of Kepler do following. First of all make sure you have directory imas-kepler inside your $HOME

.. code-block:: console

         in case you already have imas-kepler inside $HOME
         you can move it to $ITMWORK/imas-kepler
        > mv $HOME/imas-kepler $ITMWORK/imas-kepler
 
         If you don't have $HOME/imas-kepler directory, create
         it inside $ITMWORK
        > mkdir $ITMWORK/imas-kepler
 
         create symbolic link inside $HOME
        > cd $HOME
        > ln -s $ITMWORK/imas-kepler
        
Then, you can load imasenv module by calling

.. code-block:: console
                
        > module load imasenv

If there is no Kepler version installed, you will be informed by message

.. code-block:: console

Installation of "dressed" version of Kepler (with actors)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use most recent version of Kepler (with actors) do following. First of all make sure you have directory imas-kepler inside your $HOME

.. code-block:: console

        > mkdir $HOME/imas-kepler

Then, you can load imasenv module by calling

.. code-block:: console

        > module load imasenv

If there is no Kepler version installed, you will be informed by message

.. code-block:: console

IMAS Kepler 2.1.5 (release candidate)
-------------------------------------


**Most recent steps for Gateway users**

In order to use most recent version of Kepler do following. First of all make sure you have directory imas-kepler inside your $HOME

.. code-block:: console

        > mkdir -p $HOME/imas-kepler/modulefiles

Make sure to set IMAS_KEPLER_DIR variable inside .cshrc file

.. code-block:: console

        > echo "setenv IMAS_KEPLER_DIR $HOME/imas-kepler" >> ~/.cshrc
        
Now, you can load imasenv/3.21.0 module by calling

.. code-block:: console

        > module load imasenv/3.21.0

Note that this module uses kepler/2.5p2-2.1.5 instead of kepler/2.5p2-2.1.3

.. code-block:: console

        > module load imasenv/3.21.0
        IMAS environment loaded.
        Please do not forget to set database by calling 'imasdb <machine_name>' !

Now, you can install your personal Kepler installation (please note that since release 2.5p-2.1.5 and keplertools-1.7.0 it is possible to switch between different installations of Kepler (they will not collide).

.. code-block:: console

        > kepler_install my_own_kepler
        Using IMAS_KEPLER_DIR at: /pfs/work/g2michal/imas-keplers.
        Using KEPLER_SRC from KEPLER: /gw/swimas/extra/kepler/2.5p2-2.1.5.

        Kepler was installed inside /pfs/work/g2michal/imas-keplers/my_own_kepler
        Its module file is: /pfs/work/g2michal/imas-keplers/modulefiles/kepler/my_own_kepler
        To load this environment, run: module switch kepler/my_own_kepler
        To see available installations: module avail kepler



As you can see, your personal Kepler installations are available via modules. In order to switch to given version of Kepler you need to switch the module

.. code-block:: console

        > module switch kepler/my_own_kepler

Once you have set version of Kepler, you can run it by typing kepler


.. code-block:: console

        > kepler

Example grids
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example grid details
++++++++++++++++++++

This section describes a number of example grids and gives some examples
for specific constructs (object lists, subgrids).

Example Grid #1: 2d structured R,Z grid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note: the grids shown here are used in the unit tests of the grid
service library implementation, i.e. the automated testing framework.

A 2d grid in (R,Z) constructed by combining two structured
one-dimensional spaces. The spaces are defined as follows, they define
nodes and edges as subobjects.

.. image:: images/edge_1.png
   :align: center

The whole grid then looks like this (attention, slightly differing scales
in R and Z):

.. image:: images/edge_2.png
   :align: center

A couple of examples for object descriptor are given. Some explanations:

((1,1) (4,2)) = a 2d object (2d cell or face), implicitly created by
combining the 1d object (edge) no. 4 from space 1 and the 1d object no.
2 from space 2. ((1,0) (2,4)) = a 1d object (edge), implicitly created
by combining 1d object (edge) from space 1 with the 0d object (node) no.
4 from space 2. ((0,0) (2,2)) = a 0d object (node), implicitly created
by combining 0d objects (nodes) no. 2 from space 1 and no. 2 from space
2.

Object classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section shows the different object classes present in the grid. The
implicit numbering of the objects in a class is obtained by iterating
over all subobjects defining the objects, lowest space first.

Object class (1,1): 2d cells/faces. They have the following implicit
numbering:

.. image:: images/edge_3.png
   :align: center

Object class (1,0): 1d edges, aligned along the R axis ("r-aligned").
They have the following implicit numbering:

.. image:: images/edge_4.png
   :align: center

Object class (0,1): 1d edges, aligned along the Z axis ("z-aligned").
They have the following implicit numbering:

.. image:: images/edge_5.png
   :align: center

Object class (0,0): 0d nodes. They have the following implicit
numbering:

.. image:: images/edge_6.png
   :align: center


Example 2: B2 grid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Object list examples
++++++++++++++++++++

Some examples for object lists, to explain the concept and show the
notation. All examples refer to the 2d structured R,Z example grid #1
given above.
Object descriptor A single object (= and object descriptor), for object
with object class (1,1), object index (4,2).

.. code-block:: console

   ((1,1) (4,2))

Explicit object lists An explicit object list is simply an enumeration
of object descriptors. The ordering of the objects is given directly by
their position in the list. Note that by definition, all objects in the
list must be of the same class (An implementation of an explicit object
list should enforce this. If you need lists of objects with differing
class, have a look at subgrids).

An explicit list of 2d cells (faces), listing the four corner cells of
the grid in the order bottom-left, bottom-right, top-left, top-right:

.. code-block:: console

     (((1,1) (1,1)),
     ((1,1) (5,1)),
     ((1,1) (1,4)),
     ((1,1) (5,4)))

Implicit object lists Implicit object lists use the implicit order of
(sub)objects to form an efficient representation of (possibly large)
sets of objects. They thus avoid explicit enumeration of individual
objects as done in the explicit objects lists. The following examples
demonstrate the implicit list notation. Note: the implicit list notation
is used in the Python implementation of the grid service library in
exactly the form given here.

Selecting all indices An implicit object list of all r-aligned edges:

.. code-block:: console

   ((1,0) (0,0))

Object and subobject indices in the grid description start counting from
1, i.e. object no. 1 is the first object. The index 0 is special and
denotes an undefined index. In this notation, it denotes all possible
indices.

An implicit object list of the (z-aligned) boundary edges on the left
boundary of the grid:

.. code-block:: console

   ((0,1) (1,0))

The first entry of the index tuple denotes the first node in the
r-space, the second entry denotes all edges in the z space. The implicit
list denotes a total of 4 1d edges. Their implicit numbering is again
given by iterating over all defining objects, lowest space first. The
list therefore expands to

.. code-block:: console

   ((0,1) (1,1))
   ((0,1) (1,2))
   ((0,1) (1,3))
   ((0,1) (1,4))

Selecting explicit lists of indices An implicit object list of the
(z-aligned) right and left boundary edges:

.. code-block:: console

   ((0,1) ([1,6],0))

The first entry of the index tuple denotes a list of nodes in the
r-space, more specifically the first and the last (=6th) node. The
second entry denotes again all edges in the z space. The implicit list
then denotes a total of 8 1d edges in the following order:

.. code-block:: console

   ((0,1) (1,1))
   ((0,1) (6,1))
   ((0,1) (1,2))
   ((0,1) (6,2))
   ((0,1) (1,3))
   ((0,1) (6,3))
   ((0,1) (1,4))
   ((0,1) (6,4))

Selecting ranges of indices An implicit object list of all 2d cells,
except the cells on the left and right boundary.

.. code-block:: console
                
   ((1,1) ((2,4),0))

The first entry of the index tuple denotes a range of edges in the
r-space, more specifically the edges 2 to 4. The second entry of the
index tuple denotes all four edges in the z-space. The implicit list
then denotes a total of 12 2d cells in the following order:

.. code-block:: console

   ((1,1) (2,1))
   ((1,1) (3,1))
   ((1,1) (4,1))
   ((1,1) (2,2))
   ((1,1) (3,2))
   ((1,1) (4,2))
   ((1,1) (2,3))
   ((1,1) (3,3))
   ((1,1) (4,3))
   ((1,1) (2,4))
   ((1,1) (3,4))
   ((1,1) (4,4))

All implementations of the grid service library define the constant
GRID_UNDEFINED=0 to specify an undefined index. Use of GRID_UNDEFINED
instead of 0 is advised to increase the readability of the code. The
following notations are therefore equivalent
((1,0) (0,0)) = ((1,0) (GRID_UNDEFINED,GRID_UNDEFINED))
((0,1) (1,0)) = ((0,1) (1,GRID_UNDEFINED))

Subgrid examples
++++++++++++++++

A subgrid is an ordered list of grid objects of a common dimension. The
difference to object lists is that they can contain objects of different
object classes.

The subgrid concept is central to storing data on grids. To store data,
first a subgrid has to be defined. The objects in the grid have a fixed
order, which then allows to unambiguously store the data associated with
the objects in vectors.

Technically, a subgrid is an ordered list of object lists, of which
every individual list is either explicit or implicit. The ordering of
the objects in the subgrid is then directly given by the ordering of the
object lists and the ordering of the grid objects therein.

Subgrid example The following subgrid consists of all boundary edges of
the 2d R,Z example grid #1, given as four implicit object lists.

.. code-block:: console

   ((1,0) (0,1))    ! bottom edges
   ((0,1) (6,0))    ! right edges
   ((1,0) (0,5))    ! top edges
   ((0,1) (1,0))    ! left edges

Explicitly listing the objects in the order given by the subgrid gives:

.. code-block:: console

   1:  ((1,0) (1,1))    ! bottom edges    
   2:  ((1,0) (2,1))   
   3:  ((1,0) (3,1))   
   4:  ((1,0) (4,1))   
   5:  ((1,0) (5,1))   
   6:  ((0,1) (6,1))    ! right edges
   7:  ((0,1) (6,2))
   8:  ((0,1) (6,3))
   9:  ((0,1) (6,4))
   10: ((1,0) (1,5))    ! top edges
   11: ((1,0) (2,5))
   12: ((1,0) (3,5))
   13: ((1,0) (4,5))
   14: ((1,0) (5,5))
   15: ((0,1) (1,1))    ! left edges
   16: ((0,1) (1,2))    
   17: ((0,1) (1,3))    
   18: ((0,1) (1,4))    

The number at the beginning of each line is the *local index* of the
object, where local means locally in the subgrid. Note that, again,
counting starts at 1.

Grid service library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the grid service library
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Setting up the environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The grid service library requires the EU-IM data structure version 4.09a
(or later). Before using it you have to make sure your environment is
set up properly. The following section assumes you are using csh or tcsh
on the Gateway.

First, your environment variables have to be set up properly. To check
them do

.. code-block:: console

   echo $TOKAMAKNAME

It should return

.. code-block:: console

   test

Also do

.. code-block:: console

   echo $DATAVERSION

It should return

.. code-block:: console

   4.09a

(or some higher version number). If either of them returns something
different, run

.. code-block:: console

   source $EU-IMSCRIPTDIR/EU-IMv1 kepler test 4.09a > /dev/null

and check the variables again.

Second, you have to ensure your data tree is set up properly. Do

.. code-block:: console

   ls ~/public/itmdb/itm_trees/$TOKAMAKNAME/$DATAVERSION/mdsplus/0/

If you get something like "No such file or directory", you have to set
up the tree first by running

.. code-block:: console

   $EU-IMSCRIPTDIR/create_user_itm_dir $TOKAMAKNAME $DATAVERSION

and then do the previous check again.

Checking out and testing the grid service library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To be able to get the code of the grid service library, you have to be a
member of the EU-IM General Grid description (itmggd) project (you can
apply for this `here <https://gforge6.eufus.eu/gf/project/itmggd/>`__).

Once you are a member, you can check out the code by

.. code-block:: console

   svn co https://gforge6.eufus.eu/svn/itmggd itm-grid

Then you can run the unit tests for the grid service library by

.. code-block:: console

   cd itm-grid
   source setup.csh

This will setup environment variables (especially OBJECTCODE) and
aliases. Then do

.. code-block:: console

   testgrid setup

This will set up the build system for the individual languages. It will
also build and execute a Fortran program that writes a simple 2d example
grid stored in an edge CPO into shot 1, run 1.

To actually run the tests do

.. code-block:: console

   testgrid all

This will go through the implementations in the different languages
(F90, Python, ...) and run unit tests for every on of them. If all goes
well, it should end with the message

.. code-block:: console

   Test all implementations: OK

If this is not the case, something is broken and must be fixed.

Example applications (outdated)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Note: this is a bit outdated.
Have a look here.

Plotting 3d wall geometry with VisIt (temporary solution, not required any more)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example plots a 3d wall representation stored in the edge CPO (in
the future, this information will be stored in the wall CPO). The
example data used here is generated by a preprocessing tool which is
part of the ASCOT code.

1. Check out the grid service library (See above. You don't necessarily
   have to run the tests)
2. Change to the python/ directory and setup the environment:

.. code-block:: console

      cd itm-grid/python/; source setup.csh

3. Edit the file itm/examples/write_xdmf.py to use the right shot number
4. Run it (still in the python/ directory of the service library) with

.. code-block:: console

      python26 itm/examples/write_xdmf.py

   This will create two files: wall.xmf and wall.h5
   
5. Start visit with
   
.. code-block:: console

      visit23

   and open the wall.xmf file. Then select Plot->Mesh->Triangle and
   click on the "Draw" button.

Using UALConnector to visualize CPOs using the general grid description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

UALConnector allows you to bring data directly from the UAL into VisIt.

1. Check out the grid service library (See above. You don't necessarily
   have to run the tests)
2. Run UALConnector. Examples:
   
.. code-block:: console


      ./itm-grid/ualconnector -s 9001,1,1.0 -c edge -u klingshi -t test -v 4.09a

.. code-block:: console

      ./itm-grid/ualconnector -s 15,1,1.0 -c edge -u klingshi -t test -v 4.09a

3. When finished, close VisIt and terminate the UALConnector by typing
   'quit'.

You don't even have to check out the service library. UALConnector is
made available at


.. code-block:: console
                
   ~klingshi/bin/itm-grid/ualconnector

, i.e.

.. code-block:: console
                
   ~klingshi/bin/itm-grid/ualconnector -s 9001,1,1.0 -c edge -u klingshi -t test -v 4.09a

.. code-block:: console

   ~klingshi/bin/itm-grid/ualconnector -s 15,1,1.0 -c edge -u klingshi -t test -v 4.09a
