This page contains useful information on the European Transport Simulator (ETS) including documentation, description of the pre and post-processing tools used with ETS as well as instructions on how to use ETS and tools on the EUROfusion Gateway.

Configuration of the ETS-5 workflow in Kepler 
=============================================

ETS-5 uses CPO for actor integration in Kepler and as input data to the workflow. This means that the user environment
needs to be set up as ITM environment. 

**To do so login on the EUROfusion Gateway and type the following commands:**

.. code-block:: console

 module purge
 module load cineca
 module load itmenv/ETS_4.10b.10_v5.7.0
 source $ITMSCRIPTDIR/ITMv2.sh jet
 export ITM_KEPLER_DIR=$ITMWORK/my_keplers
 export _JAVA_OPTIONS="-Xss20m -Xms4g -Xmx8g -Dsun.java2d.xrender=false"

The command 'module load itmenv/ETS...' loads the itmenv environment and in particular in the case above the ETS / Kepler version 5.7.0
To load a different version just change the number e.g. v5.5.0

The $ITMSCRIPTDIR/ITMv2.sh JET command will set up your local database folder to 'JET'. This means that any simulation done with ETS
will be saved in the JET folder (even if you are simulating TCV!!). If you would like to simulate any other Tokamak, type again the command and change JET with e.g. AUG.

The remaining commands are JAVA options for running Kepler and setting of MPI useful for running parallel actors.

If it is the first time you run ETS then you will need to install your first 'dressed' Kepler version which corresponds
to Kepler with all the WPCD actors embedded in it.

**This can be done by executing the following command**

.. code-block:: console
  
 install_kepler.sh ets_v570 trunk/ETS_4.10b.10_v5.7.0/central "dressed central kepler v5.7.0"
 switch_to_kepler.sh ets_v570

**For loading the Workflow+tools (import data, postprocessing):**

.. code-block:: console

  svn co https://gforge6.eufus.eu/svn/keplerworkflows/tags/ETS_4.10b.10_v5.7.0

The above command requires enabled access to GFORGE  (if you are a 'simple' user you might need to apply for access to GFORGE). Typing the command above will check out and store the ETS_worflow.xml and useful python scripts in the directory from where it is issued. 

**Plotting routines such as kplots can be found under** 

.. code-block:: console

  >cd $KEPLER 

You are now ready to start ETS!!

**The latest version of ETS-5 is v5.5.0 (09/12/2019)**

To launch Kepler and load the ETS-5 workflow just type

.. code-block:: console

  >kepler.sh 
  
or if you like to see the the log messages printed on the scree while ETS runs

.. code-block:: console

  >kepler.sh -nolog

Once the Kepler canvas opens, chose the option 'load workflow' from the File menu and select the workflow 
you would like to load. The recommendation is to use the ETS workflow released with the version release procedure and then upload your parameter settings via the parameter file. See the option - running ETS with autoGui

A video showing how to run and set up ETS-5 can be viewed here

***********************
ETS workflows in KEPLER
***********************

The ETS workflow is used for 1-D transport simulation of a tokamak core
plasma.

**ETS workflows in KEPLER**:

-  use actors and composite actors from the WPCD / IMAS fusion library
-  complex, but clearly structured workflow, which offers user friendly
   interface for configuring the simulation
-  allow for easy modifications (connecting new modules, or reconnecting
   parts of the workflow) through an easy graphical interface
-  provide users with all updates through the version control system
-  still in active development tool (ETS-6)


**Starting the workflow:**
If you have the workflow already installed, there are several
ways to execute it:

-  For execution via kepler GUI:
   
.. code-block:: console
                
      >kepler.sh workflow_path/workflow_name.xml
          
- for executution via autoGui

.. code-block:: console

  >autoGui
  
once the GUI opens select load workflow after which a parameter file can be loaded. You can create a parameter file by loading the standard 
workflow released with the Kepler version and then chosing the option from the top menu 'save parameter file'.
The use of autoGui is strongly recommanded as worklows are large xml files while parameter files are small and do not take all your disk space. Moreover parameter files can be loaded in any version of ETS-5 by opening the standard workflow included in the release.

.. _ETS_A_4.10b_equations:

Equations to be solved and boundary conditions
----------------------------------------------

Main Plasma
~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting the run you need to select the type and value of the
boundary conditions for all equations. Please note that the value should
correspond to the type. All equations allow for following types of
boundary conditions:

-  OFF
   - equation is not solved, initial profiles will be kept for whole run
-  value
   - edge value should be specified
-  gradient
   - edge gradient should be specified
-  scale_length
   - edge scale length should be specified
-  generic
   - generic form:
   a1*yÂ´ + a2*y = a3
   of the boundary condition is assumed, 3 coefficients (a1, a2, a3) should be provided
-  value_from_input_CPO
   - equation is solved, edge value evolution will be red from input
   shot
-  profile_from_input_CPO
   - equation is not solved, profile evolution will be red from input
   shot

The particular equation will be activated if the boundary condition type
for it is other than *OFF*

.. figure:: images/ets_run_settings3.png
   :align: center
           

To set up boundary conditions:

-  right click on the box BEFORE THE TIME EVOLUTION
-  select **Configure actor**
-  select appropriate boundary condition for each equation
-  specify values for boundary conditions corresponding to the type and
   to the ion component
-  **Commit**

The workflow will not allow the user all particle components
(ions[1:NION]+electrons) to be run predictively. At least one of them shall
be set to OFF (this component will be computed from quasi-neutrality
condition).

!!! If electron density is solved, all ions with ni_bnd_type=OFF will be
computed from the quasineutrality condition and scaled proportional to
specified *ni_bnd_value* or inversely proportional to their charge,
*charge_proportional*. This is defined by option:
*ni_from_quasineutrality*.

Impurity
~~~~~~~~

You can set up the boundary conditions for impurity ions in a similar
way as for main ions. !!! Note, that at the moment only types: *OFF*;
*value* and *value_from_input_CPO* are accepter by impurity solver.

To set up boundary conditions:

-  right click on the box BEFORE THE TIME EVOLUTION
-  select **Configure actor**
-  select appropriate boundary condition for each impurity species (
   OFF-equation is not solved)
-  specify values for boundary density of each impurity component
   [1:MAX_Z_IMP], separated by commas
-  **Commit**

.. figure:: images/ets_run_settings4.png
   :align: center

Interface for impurity boundary condition has additional option,
*coronal_distribution*, that allow to preset the edge values or entire
profiles of individual ionization states from coronal distribution. In tis
case only single value is required to be specified for each impurity
boundary value. The options are:

-  OFF
   - the boundary values for impurity densities will be as they are
   specified above;
-  boundary_conditions
   - the boundary densities will be renormalized with corona, using the
   first element from above as a total density
-  boundary_conditions_and_profiles
   - the boundary densities and starting profiles will be renormalized
   with corona, using the first element from above as a total density

Neutrals
~~~~~~~~

Note, that ALL values should be specified in the order: {*1, 2, 3 ...NION, 1, 2, 3, ...NIMP*}

To set up boundary conditions:

-  right click on the box BEFORE THE TIME EVOLUTION
-  select **Configure actor**
-  select appropriate boundary condition for each neutral species (OFF-equation is not solved)
-  specify values for boundary density and temperature of each neutral component
   [1, 2, 3 ...NION, 1, 2, 3, ...NIMP], separated by commas
- **Commit**

.. figure:: images/ets_run_settings5.png
   :align: center

Input profiles interpolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are going to start the ETS run from some input shot, which might
contain some conflicting rho grids saved to different CPOs. Thus there is a
choice for the user to decide on the grid on which the starting profiles
should be load by the worflow,

*Interpolation_of_input_profiles*.

To define the interpolation grid select:

-  on_RHO_TOR_grid
   - interpolate input profiles based on the grid specyfied in [m];
-  on_RHO_TOR_NORM_grid
   - interpolate input profiles based on normalised rho grid [0:1]

.. figure:: images/ets_run_settings6.png
   :align: center
         

Convergence loop
----------------

ETS updates input from different physics actors in a sequence, which is
finished by solving the transport equations. Ther are possible
none-linear couplings between different parts of the system. These
nonelinearities are treated by the ETS using iterations. The decision to
step in time is made by the ETS based on the criteria that the maximum
relative deviation of main plasma profiles is lower than some predefined
tolerance. There is a number of settings and switches in the ETS that are
used by the iterative scheme. To edit them do:

-  right click on the box CONVERGENCE LOOP
-  select **Configure actor** to edit settings
-  choose your settings
-  **Commit**

.. figure:: images/Convergence_Loop.png
   :align: center

Switches in the field *FREQUENCY OF CALLING THE PHYSICS ACTORS* define
how many times the actors of a certain cathegory (equilibrium,
transport, etc.) should be called.


Switches and parameters in the field *CONTROL PARAMETERS* define how
iterations are done

-  Tolerance - defines the maximum relative error of profiles change compared to
   previous iteration. If it is achieved the time steping is done.

For highly none-linear case the required precision can be achieved
faster by the iterative scheme if only fraction of the new solution is
mixed to the previous state.
The following scheme is adopted by the ets to reduce none-linearities in profiles, transport coefficients and
sources:

.. code-block:: console

   Y = (Amix * Y+) + ((1-Amix)*Y-)

where Amix is the mixing fraction You can activate the mixing of
profiles, transport coefficient and sources by selecting the
corresponding *Mixing_fraction_...* to be between [0:1]
You also can activate the authomatic ajustment of this fraction by selecting:
*Ajust_Mixing_for_...* to *YES*

.. _ETS_A_4.10b_equilibrium:

Equilibrium
-----------

Initialization Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting the run you need to set up your initial equlibrium.
There are several options to do it: if your input shot contains the
consistent equilibrium with all necessary parameters - you can start
immediately from it; if your input shot contains the equilibrium but it
is not consistent or some parameters are missing you can check it
automatically; if your input equilibrium is corrupt or not present - you
can define the starting equlinbrium by tree moment description. To
select your starting equilibrium please do:

-  right click on the box BEFORE THE TIME EVOLUTION
-  select **Configure actor** to edit settings
-  Select your settings or specify values
-  **Commit**

.. figure:: images/ets_before_time.png
   :align: center


SETTINGS:

-  Equilibrium_configuration
   - select
   configure_manually
   if you like to specify configuration below; select

   ignorred).

.. figure:: images/ets_run_settings7.png
   :align: center
   
Please note, that different equilibrium solvers might require slightly
different input. Thus it is a user responsibility to check that the
information inside input shot/run is enough to run selected equilibrium
solver.

Run Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several equilibrium solvers connected to the ETS. You can
select the one of them.Therefore please do:

-  right click on the box CONVERGENCE LOOP
-  select **Open actor**
-  right click on the box EQUILIBRIUM
-  select **Configure actor** to edit settings
-  choose your equilibrium solver
-  **Commit**

.. figure:: images/ets_convergence_loop_config.png
   :align: center

*INTERPRETATIVE* means that the ETS will not update the equilibrium,
instead it will be using the initial equilibrium.

Please note, that it is better to select the same code as you used for
pre-iterrations. Because outputs of different equilibrium solver are not
necessary done with the same resolution. Therefore the routine saving
the information to the data base might brake due to uncompatible sizes
of some signals.

Transport models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ETS constructs the total transport coefficients from the combination of
Anomalous transport (model choice), Neoclassical transport (model
choice), Database transport (transport coefficients be saved to the
input shot) and Background transport (Transport coefficients defined
through the GUI interface)

D_tot = D_DB*M_DB + D_AN*M_AN + D_NC*M_NC + D_BG*M_BG

You should choose from the list of evailable models in each cathegory or
switch it **OFF**

Individual multipliers for all channels shall be specified on the lower
level through the code parameters of Transport Combiner


.. figure:: images/ets_transport2.png
   :align: center
           
Background transport
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add the constant background level for each coefficient (ion and
impurity coefficients are expected to be the strings of [1:NION] and
[1:NIMP] elements respectively, separated by commas)

.. figure:: images/ets_transport3.png
   :align: center


Edge transport barrier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section you can artificially supress the transport outside of
specified *RHO_TOR_NORM_ETB*. Total transport coefficients for all
transport channels (ne, ni, nz, Te, Ti,...) will be reduced to constant
values specified below (ion and impurity coefficients are expected to be
the strings [1:NION] and [1:NIMP] respectively)

.. figure:: images/ets_transport4.png
   :align: center

Total transport coefficients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The fine tuning of of transport coefficients can be done through editing
the XML code parameters of the **transport combiner** actor:

-  In Outline browse for transportcombiner
-  select **Configure actor**
-  click **Edit Code Parameters**
-  

   -  If you select **OFF** contributions from all transport models to this channel will be
      nullified;
   -  If you select **Multipliers_for_contributions_from** the transport channel
      will be activated, and the total transport coefficient will be
      combined from active tranport models. You gust need to specify
      multiplier against each channel;
   -  For convective velocity there is an additional option
      **V_over_D_ratio_for_contributions_from**.
      With this option selected the combiner will ignore the
      convective components provided by transport models. The convective
      velocity will be determined from the diffusion coefficient by
      applying fixed V/D ratio (
      for inward pinch the values should be negative!
      ).

.. figure:: images/ets_sources2.png
   :align: center

HCD sources
~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a number of sources developed by WPCD, that are
incorporated by the ETS workflow.

For the HCD sources please activate the type of heating source, by
ticking the box in front of it, and select the code to simulate it.

.. figure:: images/ets_sources3.png
   :align: center


You also need to configure initial HCD settings. Therefore please:

Please note that settings for NBI are done independent for each PINI.
Therefore, for NBI settings, please insert the values separated by
commas. The number of the element in the array corresponds to the number
of activated PINI. Maximum accepted number of PINIs = 16.

.. figure:: images/ets_sources5.png
   :align: center

Power control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You also can activate the power control for the IMP5HCD sources.

.. figure:: images/ets_sources6.png
   :align: center

If the POWER_CONTROL is not **OFF**, there are two modes of
operation: **specific** and **frequency**

For **specific** you should specify the time sequence separated by commas
and the corresponding power sequence (where first power level
corresponds to the first time, second to second and etc.). Linear
interpolation will be done between the sequence points. For example: if
you give the power **sequence** = 2e6,4e6,1e6 and **times** = 0.0, 0.7, 1.5 (s) the delivered power would be:

.. figure:: images/ets_sources7.png
   :align: center

For **frequency** you should specify the power levels sequence separated
by commas, start and end time of the power control and the frequency of
switching between these levels. For example: if you give the power
**sequence** = 2e6,4e6,1e6 and **frequency** = 10 (Hz) **tstart** = 0.0 (s)
**tend** = 1.5 (s) the delivered power would be:

.. figure:: images/ets_sources8.png
   :align: center

Total power
~~~~~~~~~~~

Profiles of the total source for each channel are obtained from the the
individual contributions (Data Base, Gaussian, Neutrals, Impurity and
HCD) as a summ of all activated sources multiplied with coefficients
specified on the interface of the composite actor.

S_tot = S_DS*DSM + S_GS*GSM + S_Neu*NeuSM + S_IMP*IMPSM + S_HCD*HCDSM

The fine tuning of of sources can be done through editing the XML code
parameters of the source combiner actor:

-  In the Outline browse for source combiner
-  select **Configure actor**
-  click **Edit Code Parameters**
-  If you like the sources to the particular equation being activated -
   select **from_input_CPOs**, and then, put the multipliers against each
   contribution; if you select **OFF** contributions from all sources to
   this channel will be nullified.
-  save and exit
- **Commit**

fraction â fraction of each element in the pellet, based on the number
of atoms: array of elements separated by space (1:nelements) [-]

rpell â radius of the pellet [m]

vpell â velocity of the pellet [m/s]

rcloud â radius of the pellet cloud [m], radial extension of the cloud =
2*rp0

lcloud â length of the pellet cloud along the field line [m]

Tcloud â temperature of the pellet cloud [eV]

Pellet path is specified by two points, for which R and Z coordinated
should be specified

R â R coordinates of the pivot and second points of the pellet path,
separated by space [m]

Z â Z coordinates of the pivot and second points of the pellet path,
separated by space [m]

Control switches allow to activate:

-  drifts - YES - will activate radial displacement of deposition profile, same
   for all path points
-  cooling - YES - will activate cooling of the other side of the plasma due to
   parallel heat transport (essential for large pellets, which might
   cross the same flux surface twice)
-  JINTRAC - YES - will provide temperature reduction consistent with the model
   used in JETTO

Sawtooth
~~~~~~~~

At the top level of the workflow you can switch ON/OFF possible MHD
events

-  right click on the box INSTANTANEOUS EVENTS & ACTUATORS
-  select **Configure actor** to edit settings
-  Select SAWTOOTH **ON** if you like to use them in your simulation
-  **Commit**

Actuators
~~~~~~~~~

At the top level of the workflow you can switch ON/OFF actuator for
Runaway Indicator (Runin) - this is **ON** by default. It only gives warning messages, and has no effect on the simulation results.

-  right click on the box INSTANTANEOUS EVENTS & ACTUATORS
-  select **Configure actor** to edit settings
-  Select actuator_runaways **OFF** if you'd like **not** to use Runaway Indicator in your simulation
-  **Commit**

Visualization during the run
----------------------------

There is a number tools visualizing the ETS run.

Multiple Tab Display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The display appeares automaticaly when the ETS workflow is launched. It
displays diagnostic text messages from the workflow on following topics:

-  Input data statement
-  Iterations to check the initial convergence between EQUILIBRIUM and
   CURRENT
-  Time evolution
-  Convergence of iteratinos within the time step
-  HCD settings
-  Power used by HCD actors durung the run

Also the error messages from execution of the workflow will be displayed
here.

ETSviz
~~~~~~

ETSviz is a python visualization tool with a graphical interphase that shows during the run the calculated kinetic 
profiles evolution, particle energy sources and sinks, equilibrium evolution and other useful infoirmnation.
ETSviz appears automatically during the ETS run. If you would like to launch ETSviz you can find the script in $KEPLER/kplots

*********************************************
Turbulent Flux Quantities in Transport Models
*********************************************

Overview
========

In conventional transport modelling, all quantities appearing in the
equations are 1-D, in some radial coordinate (poloidal flux, normalised
radius, etc). In general any monotonic radial coordinate is acceptable.
In the TF-EU-IM, the toroidal flux radius is standard. All we need from
the radial coordinate is the transformation to get to :math:`V,` the
volume enclosed by the flux surface, which is fundamental to the
governing equations, which are conservation laws.

What we have to do is to take a measured result, which is a
time-averaged fluctuation-based transport flux and turn it into 1-D
quantities suitable to modelling. This is done using the flux surface
average, explained in conventions. The transport equations themselves
constitute a mean field approximation to the 3-D conservation laws. For
the fundamentals encountered in transport modelling see R Hazeltine and
J Meiss, Plasma Confinement (Addison-Wesley, 1992) chapter 8. For the
special properties of transport driven by small-scale pressure driven
ExB microturbulence see B Scott, "The character of transport caused by
ExB drift turbulence," Phys Plasmas 10 (2003) 963-976.

For ambipolarity we follow the rules for dynamical alignment, which
follows the physics of how electron fluctuations determine the ExB
velocity fluctuations, which then advect all species. Magnetic flutter
nonlinearities act independently of this, but in our modelling they are
used solely for heat fluxes since the averaged particle transport due to
magnetic flutter and the current cancels, leaving the parallel ion
velocity which we neglect for this purpose. The reference for dynamical
alignment is B Scott, "Dynamical alignment in three species tokamak edge
turbulence," Phys Plasmas 12 (2005) 082305.

Note: there are now auxiliary actors provided for this purpose: IMP4DV,
which does the D/V conversion and enforces ambipolarity assuming absence
of impurities, and IMP4imp, which subsequently enforces ambipolarity for
the set of main ion and impurity species. The IMP4DV actor should be
invoked directly after the transport model actor in the workflow chain,
if the model produces only fluxes or if the coefficients have to be
modified with the flux given. Ambipolarity is done using IMP4imp if the
coreimpurity CPO is used in the workflow. 

Particle Flux as an Example
===========================

The mean field equation governing particle balance is the transport
equation for electrons,

.. math::
   
   {\partial \over \partial t} \langle n \rangle + \langle \vec \nabla \cdot \widetilde n \vec {\widetilde v}_E \rangle = S
  
in which the tilde symbol over the n and v denotes fluctuating quantities
and we neglect all transport processes except ExB eddy diffusion. The ExB
velocity is given by

.. math::
   
   \vec v_E = {c \over B^2} \vec B \times \vec \nabla \phi

where :math:`\phi` is the electrostatic potential.

The angle brackets denote the flux surface average, and we will use the
property that the flux surface average of a divergence of a vector is
the volume derivative of the flux surface average of a contravariant
volume component of the vector, in this case

.. math::

   \langle \vec \nabla \cdot \vec \Gamma \rangle = {\partial \over \partial V} \langle \Gamma^V \rangle

where :math:`\Gamma` is the particle flux whose flux-surface averaged volume component is

.. math::

   \langle \Gamma^V \rangle = \langle \widetilde n \widetilde v_E^V \rangle

This is converted to expression in terms of the radial coordinate \(
\rho` using the fact that both :math:`V` and :math:`\rho` are flux
quantities whose gradients are parallel to each other. We have

.. math::
   {\partial \over \partial V} = {1 \over V'_\rho}{\partial \over \partial \rho}\qquad \Gamma^\rho = {1\over V'_\rho}\Gamma^V \qquad V'_\rho = {\partial V \over\partial \rho} \qquad g^{VV} = (V'_\rho)^2 g^{\rho\rho}

so we can write the transport equation as

.. math::
   
   {\partial n \over \partial t}+{1 \over V'_\rho}{\partial \over \partial \rho}V'_\rho \langle \Gamma^\rho \rangle = S,

where we have replaced :math:`\langle n \rangle` with :math:`n` following the assumptions of the 1-D version of mean field transport theory.

With all quantities now expressed in terms of flux quantities, we are
free to characterise the transport flux :math:`\langle \Gamma^\rho \rangle`
in an arbitrary way, so long as only flux quantities appear. The
flux expansion within the flux surface as well as expansion or
contraction of surfaces of constant :math:`\rho` is treated using the
metric coefficient :math:`g^{ \rho \rho}` which is dimensionless. This way
we can characterise transport in terms of an effective diffusivity and
an effective frictional slip velocity which are given in SI units. By
convention both of these are done solely via :math:`g^{ \rho \rho}` for
convenience, also reflecting that the effective velocity is actually
marking off-diagonal diffusive elements. Our convention for this follows
the ETS code and is given by

.. math::
   
   \langle \Gamma^\rho \rangle = \langle g^{\rho \rho} \rangle \left( n V_{{\rm eff}} - D_{{\rm eff}}{\partial n\over \partial \rho} \right) 

So despite the special spatial distribution of any particular transport
process (ie, the underlying instability or nonlinear free energy access),
the flux-surface averaged flux itself and its expression in terms of
diffusion and frictional slip are identical characterisations.

Metric Coefficients
===================

Transport modellers want the Ds and Vs as physical quantities in SI
units. In general the fluxes are (magnetic) flux surface averaged
quantities, which implies the existence of metric elements in the
conversion. In our case we need :math:`\langle g^{\rho \rho} \rangle`
where :math:`\rho` is the toroidal flux radius in meters, so the metric
elements are dimensionless. In the equilibrium CPO, this is gm3 under
equilibrium%profiles_1d in the structure.

Note this is different from the ASTRA code which casts the Vs as proper
velocities, i.e., with one factor of grad-rho given by :math:`\langle
\sqrt{g^{\rho \rho}} \rangle` which is gm7 under
equilibrium%profiles_1d in the structure. The units are the same and the
informational content is the same, but this difference has to be taken
into account in any transport modelling and benchmarking.

Heat Fluxes
===========

The heat flux is treated in a similar way, with transport equation

.. math::
   
   {3 \over 2}{\partial p_e \over \partial t} +{1 \over V'_\rho}{\partial \over \partial \rho} V'_\rho \langle q_e^\rho \rangle = Q_e + \sum_{{\rm ions}}T_{ei},

for electrons, with :math:`T_{ei}` giving the species transfer and :math:`Q_e`
the source. For ExB transport the heat flux has a advective (also
called convective) and a conductive piece given by

.. math::
   
   q_E = q_E{}_{{\rm cond}} + (3/2) T \Gamma_E

which appears with a 3/2 due to the Poynting cancellation. For
magnetic flutter transport the advective piece appears with the usual
factor,

.. math::
   
   q_m = q_m{}_{{\rm cond}} + (5/2) T \Gamma_m

Here the forms are given for each species and :math:`E` and :math:`m` refer
to the ExB eddy and magnetic flutter channels, respectively. For reasons
given below we are neglecting the magnetic flutter piece :math:`\Gamma_m`
for the time being, and then the flutter piece merely adds to the heat
diffusivity.

The forms of these due to the fluctuations are then

.. math::
   
   \langle q^\rho \rangle = (3/2) \langle \widetilde p \widetilde v_E^\rho \rangle + \langle \widetilde q_\parallel \widetilde b^\rho \rangle

which breaks into advective and conductive pieces according to linearisation
of the pressure fluctuations

.. math::

   \langle q_{{\rm cond}}^\rho\rangle = (3/2) n \langle \widetilde T \widetilde v_E^\rho\rangle + \langle \widetilde q_\parallel \widetilde b^\rho\rangle \qquad\qquad \langle q_{{\rm adv}}^\rho \rangle = (3/2)T \Gamma = (3/2)T\langle\widetilde n \widetilde v_E^\rho \rangle

hence the density fluctuation piece is accounted for by the particle flux.
Neglect of the magnetic flutter advective piece (and particle flux) is the
same as neglect of the :math:`{\widetilde u_\parallel} {\widetilde b^ \rho}` nonlinearity (in the delivery of the results, not in the turbulence
computations themselves).

The total conductive flux is then represented by

.. math::
   
   \langle q_{{\rm cond}}^\rho \rangle = \langle g^{\rho \rho} \rangle \left( nTY_{{\rm eff}} - n \chi_{{\rm eff}}{\partial T \over \partial \rho} \right)

with :math:`\chi` and :math:`Y` giving the heat diffusion and frictional
slip pieces for each species, respectively (these are in diff_eff and
vconv_eff in the CPO for each quantity).

Operationally, the turbulence module communicates the diff_eff and
vconv_eff due to each transport channel for each species to the
transport solver, and the metric coefficients are used by both modules.
The two modules can be on arbitrarily different grids, which communicate
through standard interpolation. This despite the fact that transport at
the micro-level is angle dependent (in general, it can be 3-D in the
time average if the sources are 3-D). The effective transport is 1-D so
long as parallel sound transit within the flux surface remains fast
compared to the local transport time. This breaks down anyway in the
edge, so the fact that the volume is a problematic coordinate and the
flux surface average is a problematic operation on open field lines
doesn't enter.

Ds and Vs from Turbulence Codes to Transport Solvers
====================================================

To serve the results from turbulence codes to transport solvers, we have
to turn the fluxes (results) into diffusivities and effective velocities
(coefficients, Ds and Vs for short), which represent more information
than is at hand. Transport solvers must work with Ds and Vs because they
use implicit schemes. The matrix must be diagonally dominant; hence one
cannot simply use the Vs. Fluxes which are zero and/or negative should
be given with positive diffusivities for the solvers to work. We need a
set of rules to provide this.

Considering the particle and heat transport fluxes for a given species,
we convert the gradient in to a logarithmic derivative and express the
flux in terms of a specific flux, which has units of velocity,

.. math::
   
   F &= \frac{1}{n} \langle g^{\rho\rho}\rangle^{-1} \langle \Gamma^\rho \rangle= V_{{\rm eff}} - D_{{\rm eff}}\frac{\partial \log n}{\partial \rho}\\
   G &= \frac{1}{nT} \langle g^{\rho \rho} \rangle^{-1} \langle q^\rho_{{\rm cond}}\rangle = Y_{{\rm eff}} - \chi_{{\rm eff}}\frac{\partial \log T}{\partial \rho} 

wherein the conductive part of the heat flux (without the :math:`3 \Gamma / 2` enters.

The choice of what to do with the Ds and Vs is somewhat arbitrary. The
needs of implicit transport solvers is for a positive D regardless of
the value or sign of either flux. We decide this by putting a limit on
the effective Prandtl number or its inverse: the larger specific flux is
taken to be entirely diffusive, with the effective velocity set to zero.
Furthermore, to address cases with very small or negative gradients, we
use proxy variables for the scale lengths to calculate the provisional
diffusivities before using the Prandtl number limitation to turn these
into actual diffusivities. Finally, the rest of the flux is asigned to
the effective velocity, so that the D and V formula reflects the actual
specific flux.

The Prandtl number limitation is expressed as follows. If the smaller
specific flux is within a factor of 5 of the larger, then both are
purely diffusive and the effective velocities are both zero. If not,
then the D ratio is set to 5, with the result that the smaller D, having
been corrected, is accompanied by the corresponding V, which is now
nonzero. The specific flux with the larger D will be returned with a V
which is zero.

The rationale is that the turbulent mixing by the ExB velocity affects
all processes, but that linear forcing can shift the average phase shift
of the fluctuations such that the effective flux can be small or
negative. The simplest example is adiabatic electrons, for which the ion
heat flux is robust but the particle flux is zero. In most situations
the specific heat flux will be the larger, and hence the familiar
situation is that of a D and V for the particle flux but a D (the chi)
only for the conductive heat flux.

The full algorithm starting with the specific fluxes appears as

.. math::
   
   L_n^{-1} &= \max \left( {1 \over R}, \left\vert {\partial \log n \over \partial \rho} \right\vert \right) \quad L_T^{-1} = \max \left( {1 \over R},\left\vert {\partial \log T \over \partial \rho} \right\vert \right)\\
   D' &=\left \vert F \right \vert L_n \quad \chi' = \left \vert G \right \vert L_T \\
   D &= \max \left( D', {1\over 5} \chi' \right) \quad \chi = \max\left( \chi', {1 \over 5} D' \right) \\
   V &= \left( F + D {\partial \log n \over \partial \rho} \right) \quad Y = \left( G + \chi \frac{\partial \log T}{\partial \rho} \right)

and all four elements are set. Note that the channels are done in parallel
except for the Prandtl correction, in which the Max's are taken
sequentially. For the provisional diffusivities, absolute values are used
to ensure positive values which are needed by transport solvers.

Note how in the end the actual gradients are used. If the gradients are
moderate then their actual values are used, and if the Prandtl
correction is not invoked, then both channels are diagonal. In any case
the full relation is used to get the effective velocities (V and Y) so
having set the rules to handle the arbitrariness of the diffusivities (D
and chi) to guarantee reasonable diagonal dominance in a transport
solver, the D's and V's agree with the fluxes themselves.

If there are more than two specific fluxes per species to consider, then
we treat each scale length separately as above and use N-way maxima in
the Prandtl correction for the N channels.

Ambipolarity
============

There remains the issue of ambipolarity of the D and V for particle
flux. For a pure singly charged plasma the ion and electron Ds and Vs
should be equal. Even if the turbulence model is gyrokinetic or
gyrofluid, in which case the gyrocenter charge density is not zero but
is equal to the generalised vorticity (polarisation), the quantities
given to a transport solver should follow the rules for a fluid
representation. However, transport modelling usually applies
ambipolarity rules to the electrons after computing the ions, while the
action of turbulence is actually the other way around: Dynamical
alignment refers to the process by which (1) electron parallel dynamics
controls the electrostatic fluctuations, then (2) the resulting ExB
velocity advects all species equally. So we correct the particle fluxes
by assuming the electrons determine the D according to the above
procedure and then (1) the fluctuations in the flux-inducing part of the
spectrum for the logarithmic densities are the same, and (2) the D's are
the same. Then the V's are solved for again, by taking

.. math::
   
   D_z = D_e = D \qquad \qquad V_z = V_e + D {\partial \log b_z \over \partial \rho} \qquad \qquad b_z = n_z/n_e

This is better than the transport modelling convention but will give them
the same information in a different way, and they will compute ambipolar
particle fluxes (radial transport of charge is zero).

Statistical Character
=====================

Turbulence has a statistical character, so convergence to a mean is not
monotonic and when within one std dev of the mean there is no further
convergence. The diffusivity for ExB turbulence is comparable to

.. math::
   
   D_E = \left. \langle (\widetilde v_E)^2 \rangle \right / \langle (\varpi)^2 \rangle^{1/2} \qquad \qquad \varpi_E = {c \over B} \nabla_\perp^2 \widetilde \phi

where :math:`\varpi_E` is the ExB vorticity fluctuation, and these angle
brackets denote the ensemble average. To get an ensemble average over a
statistical quantity in practice, one must do some sort of finite-time
running averaging.

For transport modelling, the transport coefficients derived from a
turbulence code should always be given in terms of `running exponential
averages. <#imp4_exponential_averages>`__

 Running Exponential Average

Overview
========

In conventional transport modelling, turbulent fluxes are modelled in terms
of processes which are diffusive in the local relaxation sense, with the
average flux given by a diffusion coefficient and an effective pinch
velocity. The equations are of dominantly parabolic character, which means
in practice that an iterate will move monotonically towards the solution in
parameter space.

This is not the case for turbulence. Convergence is statistical, which is
something different than a diffusive relaxation. If turbulence is
stationary, it is meant only that the mean of a distribution of iterates is
stationary, not the iterates themselves. The standard deviation can be
significant, of order unity compared to the mean, of any distribution of
iterates.

This makes for a noisy signal if the output of a turbulence code is used
for transport coefficients in a workflow. A sound way to overcome the
attendant problems is to use a moving average. Even an average over a
moving window can be as noisy as the original signal, however. What works
better is a weighted average over recent past values. A method to get this
is called a running exponential average, which is essentially the same
thing as a convolution integral over an exponential memory decay times the
past signal. It turns out to be very easy to obtain this without saving
past values.

Definition
==========

Consider a process :math:`p ( \vec u )` which is a functional of dependent
variables :math:`\vec u`. Measure :math:`p` at discrete time intervals
:math:`t_n,` with values :math:`p_n=p(t_n)` and interval length 
:math:`\tau=t_n-t_{n-1}`. The moving exponential average :math:`A_n=A(p_n)`
on the :math:`n \hbox{-th}` interval is defined as

.. math::
   
   A_n = \epsilon p_n + (1-\epsilon)A_{n-1} \qquad \qquad \hbox{with} \qquad \epsilon=\alpha \tau

in which the small parameter :math:`\epsilon` is given in terms of the interval :math:`\tau` and an inverse time constant :math:`\alpha.`

In the first instance :math:`p` is measured there is no :math:`A` so the
first value of :math:`A` is simply set to :math:`p` since it can be
assumed that the initial state for :math:`p` has persisted for infinite
previous time up to the initial time point.

Differential Equation
=====================

The equivalent differential equation is found by forming the relevant
finite difference,

.. math::
   
   A_n - A_{n-1} = \epsilon (p_n - A_{n-1})

which we can also cast as

.. math::
   
   (1-\epsilon)(A_n - A_{n-1}) = \epsilon (p_n - A_n)

Taking the limit :math:`\tau \to 0` is the same as taking :math:`\epsilon \to 0` so both of these expressions become equivalent to

.. math::
   
   {\partial A \over \partial t} = \alpha(p-A)

whose solution is given below.

Equivalence to Past-Time Convolution Integral
=============================================

The solution of the above differential equation is given by the method
of undetermined coefficients,

.. math::

   {\partial A \over \partial t} +\alpha A = \alpha p \ \ e^{-\alpha t}{\partial \over \partial t} \left( e^{ \alpha t} A \right) = \alpha p \ \ {\partial \over \partial t} \left( e^{\alpha t} A \right) = \alpha p e^{\alpha t}

We may integrate this over all past time, to find

.. math::
   
   A(t) = \int_{-\infty}^t \alpha dt' p(t') e^{-\alpha (t-t') }

This is a convolution integral over the kernel :math:`e^{-\alpha(t-t')}`
and the signal :math:`p(t')`. The time constant :math:`\alpha^{-1}` is
just the memory decay time, while if :math:`p` is constant then the
integral yields unity times :math:`p`. This is the same as the
normalisation with the :math:`(1-\epsilon)` factor in the average formula
above, which is needed since the interval is of finite size.

Hence the running exponential average is operationally the same as a memory
decay integral over past time. The elegant feature is the need to keep only
the current value of :math:`A`, as it already contains all that is needed
of the past time evolution of :math:`p`.

notes
=====

Some properties of the running exponential average and how to choose its
main time-memory parameter:

-  The :math:`(1-\epsilon)` factor is needed for normalisation
-  if :math:`p=\hbox{constant}` then :math:`A=p` for all :math:`t`
   
  -  the integral with :math:`\alpha dt'` yields unity
  -  the :math:`\epsilon` and :math:`(1-\epsilon)` factors add to unity
  -  therefore set the first value of :math:`A` to the first value of :math:`p`

-  in choosing the memory decay time :math:`\alpha^{-1} \dots`
   
  -  one should have :math:`\alpha \tau_{cor} \ll 1`
  -  best results are for :math:`\alpha \tau_{sat} \sim 1`
  -  some trial/error required; edge turbulence likes :math:`\alpha^{-1}=200 L_\parallel / c_s`

In these expressions :math:`\tau_{{cor}}` and :math:`\tau_{{sat}}` are
the correlation and saturation times of the turbulence, respectively.
